# Part C - Pong!

## Comments
In programming, we often work with other people’s code. In a work environment, you work in collaboration with many other developers and some of their code may not always be clear to others. So, people usually leave comments in the code. In Python, anything after a *#* is a comment. This means anything after the *#* is not part of the code and is just used for explanations. 

In the pong code, we’ve added comments to help understand what’s happening.

## Let’s Run the Code 
Open the *pong.py* file. Let’s read through the code and see what it’s doing.
Now that you have an idea of what’s happening, let’s play some pong.

## Let’s Make Some Changes
In the *pong_v2* code, a few variables have been highlighted. These are variables you can set to change the speed or the ball, the speed of the paddle or the hit zone of the paddle. For example,

```python
# initial speed and direction for the ball to move:
################# INPUT HERE ######################
ball.speed(30)  # sets your ball speed
###################################################
ball.dx = 5
ball.dy = -5
```

Try changing them and see what happens! 

What other changes can you make?
