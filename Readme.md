# Hello and welcome to WIE Winnipeg's Python Programming Workshop!
Thanks for joining us! 
We hope that while you're here you'll learn a thing or two about what's possible with computer programming, 
and what sort of career opportunities may come your way if you decide to pursue programming in the future. 
For starters, we'll provide you with some basic tools to get acquainted with the Python programming language. 
Next, we'll dive a little deeper and show you how to create, customize and play your very own **Pong** game! 

While the lessons in this workshop are all specific to Python, most programming languages have some common elements. 
So learning the foundations of one language will help make the task of learning other language much easier in the future.

Let's get started and have some fun!
